# Phase 2: Rook-Ceph 3-Tier Distributed Storage Cluster

This guide outlines the deployment architecture and Kubernetes manifests for **[Rook-Ceph](https://rook.io/)** — our cloud-native storage orchestrator providing block (`RBD`), shared file system (`CephFS`), and object storage across 3 distinct hardware performance tiers.

## 💾 3-Tier Storage Pool Topology

| Storage Tier | Physical Drive Pool | Total Raw Capacity | Intended Cluster Workloads |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (High-IOPS NVMe)** | 2x 2TB NVMe (`sm-node-01/02`) + 1x 1TB NVMe (`pc-node-05`) | **5.0 TB** | `etcd` WAL, PostgreSQL/Redis databases, Ceph RocksDB/WAL metadata, Ollama AI model weights. |
| **Tier 2 (SATA SSD Replicated)** | 8x 2TB Crucial MX500 SATA SSDs (`sm-node-01`, `02`, `03`) | **16.0 TB** | Replicated Block (`RBD`) & File (`CephFS`) PVCs for active apps (TeslaMate, Actual Budget, Mealie, Immich). |
| **Tier 3 (Bulk HDD Erasure-Coded)** | 11x Mechanical HDDs in `pc-node-04` (4x 4TB NAS + 2x 2TB Enterprise + 3TB + 1.5TB + 2x 1TB + 500GB) | **27.0 TB** | Erasure-coded bulk object storage, MinIO S3 target, Velero cluster backups, media archives. |

## 🛠 Storage Network Isolation (VLAN 40)

To prevent Ceph storage replication traffic from competing with Kubernetes API or application pod traffic, all Rook-Ceph OSD East-West traffic is routed over **VLAN 40 (`CEPH-STORAGE`)** using **10GbE SFP+ interfaces with MTU 9000 (Jumbo Frames)**.
